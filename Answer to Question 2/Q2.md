The law of mass action states that the rate of a chemical reaction is proportional to the product of the concentrations of the reactants. Using this principle, we can write down four differential equations to describe the rate of change of the four species in the enzyme reaction:

- d[E]/dt = -k1[E] [S] + k2[ES]
- d[S]/dt = -k1[E] [S] + k2[ES] + k3[ES]
- d[ES]/dt = k1[E] [S] - k2[ES] - k3[ES]
- d[P]/dt = k3[ES]

In these equations, [E], [S], [ES], and [P] represent the concentrations of the species E, S, ES, and P, respectively, and d[E]/dt, d[S]/dt, d[ES]/dt, and d[P]/dt represent the rates of change of these concentrations over time. The constants k1, k2, and k3 are the forward and reverse rate constants for the reactions, which determine the rate at which the reactions occur.

These differential equations can be solved numerically, using a computer program or mathematical software, to calculate the concentration of each species at any given time. This allows researchers to simulate the enzyme reaction under different conditions and to analyze the effects of different variables, such as substrate concentration, enzyme concentration, and temperature, on the reaction rate and product yield.
